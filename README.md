# Rust Docs MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides access to Rust documentation from docs.rs. This server allows AI tools to search for documentation, type information, feature flags, version numbers, and symbol definitions/source code.

## Features

- Search for crates on docs.rs
- Get documentation for specific crates and versions
- Get type information (structs, enums, traits, etc.)
- Get feature flags for crates
- Get available versions for crates
- Get source code for specific items
- Search for symbols within crates

## Installation

This project uses npm for dependency management and TypeScript compilation.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-docs-mcp-server.git
cd rust-docs-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Building

```bash
# Build the server
npm run build
```

This will create a build directory with the compiled JavaScript files.

## Running

```bash
# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Or run the built server
npm run start
```
